# React + TypeScript + Vite

# Frontend setup

This frontend is powered by React, TypeScript, and Vite. To run it locally:

1. From the `frontend` directory run `npm install`. A local `.npmrc` ensures devDependencies (like Vite) are always installed, even if your environment has `NODE_ENV=production` set globally.
2. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
3. Build for production with `npm run build`.
